# MakeIt.Wrap

MakeIt.Wrap is a framework for Unity to aid in the creation of wrap-around
worlds.

It is a work-in-progress (or rather a work-on-hold), and should not be treated
as production-ready.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

MakeIt.Wrap depends on the following Unity packags:

* [MakeIt.Core](https://github.com/againey)

Optional dependencies will unlock additional features:

* [MakeIt.Tile](https://github.com/againey) for tile-based wrap-around worlds

### Installing

This repository is arranged as a valid Unity package that can be imported into a
Unity project using the instructions in [the Unity Package Manager Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html).

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/your/project/tags). 

MakeIt.Wrap was originally part of a collection of private projects in a
single repository, so some of that shared history still exists within this
repository. Releases for other projects before the split are also tagged, such
as `makeit-random-v1.0`.
